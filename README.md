# Achievements
This repository currently contains just a single .SVG file with various achievement graphics within. They are meant to **be printed** (yes, analouge, old school you know) and to handed over to your team members to honor their work.

The logos used are mostly open source ones and if not, I applogize that I have taken them to create my own new creative work in the context of achievements. If someone out there has a problem with it, let me know.
